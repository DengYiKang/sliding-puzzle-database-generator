# sliding-puzzle-database-generator

A sliding puzzle additive disjoint pattern database generator written in Java,
based on Korf and Felner's 
[Disjoint pattern database heuristics paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222830183_Disjoint_pattern_database_heuristics).

Currently, the only way to run this application is by writing your own Java file.

Driver.java contains an example of how to generate pattern databases, generating 6-6-3 pattern databases for 4x4 puzzles
for every possible empty position/blank tile.
